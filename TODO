TODO list

- find all defaults and document them
- find all debug logs and document them
- find all used .plist keys/values and document them (STLanguageManager,...)
- optimalise method execution - each time language manager is fetched -can be expensive

HIGH PRIORITY 

- implement NSRect object
- Rewrite Smalltalk compiler (grammar)

        Remove STBytecodeInterpreter and use only STCompiler. How?
        Simply convert language constructions into 'command' objects like
        SmalltalkStatement, SmalltalkPrimary, SmalltalkMethodSend, ...
        and implement executeInEnvironment:context:receiver:
        
- Update application scripting to use STConversation

LOW PRIORITY

UNDEFINED

- handle 'connection did die' notification for distant objects in STEnvironment
- fix class-info lookup for proxies in STEnvironment
- Smalltalk: separate compiler and compilation context
- create a 'Shell' scripting environment
- Create ApplicationScripting framework, instead of bundle. It should offer
   passive application scripting (without linking) and active app. scripting
   (linking with the framewotk). Give it some reasonable name, becauase that one
   is already used by Apple
- Add framework list into environment description
- Change Modules to Frameworks
- Fill implementation of STScriptObject, STMethod and related STEngine methods
- Remove empty directories (Source, Modules/StepTalk)
- Replace STMethod languageName with map table of method class->engine class
