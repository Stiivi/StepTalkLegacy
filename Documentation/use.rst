Possible use of StepTalk
####################

StepTalk Shell:
 
- interactive communication with remote objects

for example i am using it for writing simple tests or for playing with gnustep
classes

moreover, the steptalk shell can be used for gnustep-novices to learn about
gnustep-classes and their behavior

or, as i am using it, to communicate interactively with an distant object
