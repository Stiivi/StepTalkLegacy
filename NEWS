0.9.1

    * Actor class - STActor. For more information see attached example or
    Examples/Smalltalk/stactor.st
    * fixes after GNUstep-base fixes of NSUnknownKey

0.9.0

    * Changed "full scripting" behaviour. When enabled, all classes are
    available for scripting, not only those published by frameworks.
    * There was done design fix in the Smalltalk language bundle. Instance
    variables of script objects were accessed by index, now they are
    referenced by names. This allows further creation of STActor
    (STScriptObject successor) object that is composed of script methods and
    ivars. Also it would be possible to create script methods for any objc
    receiver. Ivar access is done through KVC. For more information do not
    hesitate to ask.

0.8.2

    * Fixed and changed license to LGPL
    * Several fixes from Mateu Batle for the framework and Smalltalk bundle
    * Fixed bug with signed/unsigned bytecode in the Smalltalk bundle

0.8.1

    * Added ReadlineTranscript
    * Renamed, added and deprecated some STEnvironment methods. Methods were
    not removed, NSLog warnings were added.

    * Added STConversation object. Basically, it's a conversation with 
    objects in an environment using a scripting language. The reason
    for creating this clas was to open a path for easier remote scripting
    where you can 'talk in a conversation' with a remote DO server or
    application. However, this remote part is just going to be implemented.
